                    preoccupied CEOs of Silva Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by
                    performing death-defying stunts and posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. So, this
                    day, he decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the
                    finish line – using a grenade.</p>

Daughter of the Games’ lead electrical engineer Luc Paquette, she studied his manuals to stay close to him, and discovered her calling at a young age. Though she could be completely distracted one moment and hyper-focused the next, electricity grounded her – its ordered, predictable flow made sense in a way the rest of the world didn’t.</p>
